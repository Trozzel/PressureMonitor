# Skerl Box Demo - December 8, 2021

## 1. Background:

* There are custom, in-house built cards. We do not have access to the full schematics of these cards and the gentleman who designed these cards is no longer with us.
* Therefore, we must design a means to communicate with the NEFF without having to create custom made cards.


## 2. Hardware

![diagram](Skerl%20box%20hardware%20proposal.png)

* CL100 - CentOS 7 (perhaps move to CentOS 6?)
* Measurement Computing H96-DIO
* A USB to RS232 converter
* USB-A to USB-B cable (MCC H96-DIO to CL100)
* If connecting to monitor: 
  * HDMI cable
  * Monitor
  * USB Keyboard
  * USB Mouse
* Custom cable (DB37 to breakout):
  * End 1: DB37 backshell
    * Connects to backplane of Neff
  * End 2: breakout to 32 pins
    * Connects to front of MCC H96-DIO

## 3. Required Software

* Required for CentOS 7
  * ``sudo yum group install "Development Tools"``
    * Installs up-to-date GCC Toolchain
    * Must update ``PATH`` and ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to point to ``lib`` and ``bin`` installs of above
  * ``sudo yum install cmake``
    * * Must update ``PATH`` to ensure that the new ``cmake`` (if already installed on CentOS) precedes that of the system ``cmake``
  * Qt
    * Good luck. Jk.
    * Requires, at a minimum, ``Qt5``
    * **NOTE:** I have been unable, up until this point, to successfully install ``Qt`` on the CentOS machine
* Custom SkerlBox software
  * Place the software into the directory in which user wants it
  * Then, enter these commands
    * ``cd build``
    * ``cmake ..``
    * ``make``
    * ``sudo make install``
  * The above commands will:
    1. Create the ``Makefile``
    2. Build the project (and other projects) into the ``build`` directory
       * **TODO:** Need to remove extraneous projects that were used for development
    3. Create and send the custom libraries to ``/usr/local/lib``
    4. Copy the associated headers to ``/usr/local/include/skerlbox``

## 4. Software Design

#### Class Diagram

![class diagram](SkerlBox%20Class%20Diagram.png)

#### Functional software

* Implements open-source ``serialib`` library to communicate via RS232
* At the core of software, the *Observer Pattern* is used. This enables ease of adding more *Observable* items
  * Ruska
  * Laurel encoder
  * Anything else, not just RS232
* It also facilitates any kind of *Observer*
  * ``stdout``
  * Qt gui
  * Writing to files
  * Web-based app, if desired
  * Anything...

#### Graphical Software

* Created with Qt6 on a Ubuntu machine, but should be compilable on any machine
* The GUI is an *Observer* of whatever *Observable* item you desire.
* Not needed to communicate with serial device or the H96-DIO
